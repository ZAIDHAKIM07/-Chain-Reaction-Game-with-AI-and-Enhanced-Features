# Chain Reaction Game with AI and Enhanced Features

## Overview

Welcome to the **Chain Reaction Game**, a strategic 2D board game where players battle to dominate the board by strategically placing gems. This project features an AI opponent and includes enhancements such as an "Undo Last Move" function and a "Restart Game" option, offering players more control and a better gameplay experience.

## Features

- **AI Opponent**: Play against a computer-controlled opponent with varying difficulty levels.
- **Undo Last Move**: Allows players to revert their last move, providing flexibility in strategy.
- **Restart Game**: Easily restart the game with a clean slate at any point.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: The goal is to fill the board with your gems by making strategic moves and causing chain reactions to spread your gems across the board.
2. **Moves**: Players take turns placing gems. When a cell's gem count reaches its neighboring cell count, it overflows, spreading gems to adjacent cells.
3. **Winning**: The game ends when the board is filled with one player's gems.
